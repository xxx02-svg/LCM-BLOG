            The night was a battlefield where schedules clashed like rival waves, vying for dominance under the vast expanse of a moonlit sky. As the clock struck seven, the arena—our stage—buzzed with anticipation, the echoes of preparations humming like an overture. Our team, steadfast as ancient oaks, arrived brimming with purpose, only to find that the space was claimed by a tempest of the opposite kind: the neighboring crew, predominantly women, their presence as commanding as a sunrise stealing the darkness.
            In the spirit of harmony, we stepped back, letting their energy flood the stage. Their voices were like the rustling of autumn leaves, sharp yet soft, shaping the evening into a choreography of shared resolve. As the hours ticked on, the hands of time moved like a slow-burning candle, consuming the night inch by inch.  
            Finally, at the witching hour, the stage was ours. Our gladi bersih became a symphony of determination, where every step, note, and cue felt like threading a needle in the dimmest light. The hours blended into each other, the night growing colder, and our bodies heavier. Yet, the fire in our spirits burned brighter, unyielding against the relentless march of fatigue.  
            By 5 a.m., as the first hues of dawn kissed the sky, we wrapped up. Our eyelids weighed like iron gates, and the promise of sleep beckoned us like a distant mirage. But the day ahead loomed large, and rest was but a fleeting dream. We trudged home, knowing the morning sun would find us awake once more, donning smiles that hid the exhaustion carved deep within.
